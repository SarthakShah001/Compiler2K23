Produce a list of all syntax errors with appropriate messages and line numbers .a

FILE *getStream(FILE *fp): This function takes the input from the file pointed to by file pointer 'fp'. This file is the source code written in the given language. The function uses efficient technique to bring the fixed sized piece of source code into the memory for processing so as to avoid intensive I/O operations mixed with CPU intensive tasks. 

ComputeFirstAndFollowSets(grammar G, FirstAndFollow F):

createParseTable(FirstAndFollow F, table T):

parseInputSourceCode(char *testcaseFile, table T): This function takes as input the source code file and parses using the rules as per the predictive parse table T and returns a parse tree.

The function must report all errors appropriately (with line numbers) if the source code is syntactically incorrect.
The function must display a message "Input source code is syntactically correct..........." for successful parsing. 

printParseTree(parseTree PT, char *outfile): The output is such that each line of the file outfile must contain the information corresponding to the currently visited node of the parse tree in the following format :-
lexeme CurrentNode lineno tokenName valueIfNumber  parentNodeSymbol isLeafNode(yes/no) NodeSymbol
